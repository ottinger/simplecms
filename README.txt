This is a simple CMS that I threw together to serve as the foundation for some
other stuff i'll be building. I'll probably improve it over time, but at the moment
it is quite rudimentary.

Here's what you'll need to do to get it working:
- Throw all the php files in the directory on your server and set permissions
  (644 should work fine)
- Create a database using "simplecms.sql" on your MySQL server
- Open "settings.php", and modify all settings as indicated. These
  include your SQL address, database name, and login info, as well
  as the site name and admin username/password.
- Go to "sc-login.php" to log in and add/delete/modify posts.
- Go to "sc-list.php" to read list of posts, then click each link to read them.

Here's a list of files:
- README: you're reading it right now
- footer.php: footer used in all pages
- header.php: header used in all pages
- settings.php: settings used in all php files
- sqlconnect.php: code used to connect to SQL server
- style.css: CSS style used in all pages
- sc-delpost.php: used to execute post deletion
- sc-editpost.php: used to display post edit page and execute post edit
- sc-listposts.php: used to display "index" page; lists posts
- sc-login.php: handles login/logout; displays login page
- sc-showpost.php: displays each post
- sc-submitpost.php: used to handle submission of post and add to database
- index.php: contains redirect to sc-listposts.php
